It is, I am given to understand, no new nor profound knowledge that everything in human world is, to some degree, political. Politics, at the root level, is just opinions whereby one endeavours to derive policy from; therefore, just like a living human being cannot 'have no opinion', he cannot be 'whole-heartedly apolitical'. A parallel apparent truth is that all men, however isolated from society, remains a social animal; and again cannot be entirely apolitical. For, however he who dwells in the innermost of the wilderness should shun it, the very act of isolating himself by escaping society and politics is one of the purest and most symbolic political acts.

Whereas from that which I observe lately many do not believe so. Some fail to rememberâ€”often deliberatelyâ€”this most familiar axiom of human nature, which should have been rooted-deeply already in every one of our souls since Aristotle, at least. A late exemplar can be easily seen should you go to websites of [React.js](https://reactjs.org), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and so forthâ€”an often criticised banner can be seen: 'Support Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, Help Provide Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine. ' it says. The criticisers claim that tech should be free from politics, thus such act of trying to help victims of war out is to be condemned.

Well, then, if one must not participate in political activities, how does he achieve that?

Following the sound reasoning of why organisations must not express their political views from criticisers, their answer to this questions is yet simple: be blind. The aforementioned forgetfulness often involves the notion of disregarding reality; that is, to remark nothing upon the inconstant phantasmagorias that should soon pass as a dream before you: work nothing out of it, reflect nothing upon the matter, better see nothing of it, and most importantly keep the, as the old proverb goes, 'golden silence'. These very sound arguments may be deemed sagacious and learned till we should examine their emptinessâ€”what, for instance, is all this rigmarole about facing the changes of modern world with no reactions but a more pompous way of phrasing conservatism? how, I ask, is all this gibberish about keeping silent better than 'don't ask, don't tell'?

To say that 'I am apolitical', is nothing less political than saying 'I stand with Ukraine'â€”for it is indeed opinions and statements which construct politics, and the assertion above is both.
