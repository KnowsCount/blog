title: "\U0001FAC0 An Elegy to Keats"
---

Poet! Thy verse is like a sacred song,<br>
That from the Nine was as a Gift deriv'd:<br>
A craft that even Poesy's God would long<br>
To claim his authorship thou has contriv'd<br>
To pen; to pen, aye, pen instead of steal<br>
The workmanship of God—for many more<br>
Of Such fine works thou hast produc'd, appeal'd<br>
To me and to the wise in days of yore.<br>
I mourn your death! I mourn the timeless loss<br>
To Poesy's Realm your early death begot;<br>
I mourn we, reading, ne'er again across<br>
Some oceans new your wondrous pen has wrought<br>
May swim—O Keats! Thy verse is ne'er forgot;<br>
Thou hast descent; thy Psyche aw'd has not.
