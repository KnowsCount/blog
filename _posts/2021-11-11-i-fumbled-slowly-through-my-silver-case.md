title: "\U0001F320 I fumbled slowly through my silver case"
---

I fumbled slowly through my silver case,<br>
The silver case God gave me on that day<br>
Of memories I had: I could not chase,<br>
As they had fled by the heavenly bay.<br>
I mocked the case. But wryly I did cry <br>
For all the wealth, the fame, the fancy pride<br>
Turned into nothingness. All others die:<br>
The friends, the knowledge, the beloved bride.<br>
How sad I was? How quickly did the sky<br>
Fade into nothingness too? And the stars<br>
Laughed abrupt: as so weakly snivelled I,<br>
For my memories lost; tingling my scars,<br>
Of the harms I had done in prior years,<br>
Of the harms which shed with my dropping tears.<br>
