Should selfsame piles our city growth must raise<br>
Upon the land where Nymphs and Fauns abide,<br>
Where birds on cypress gaily sing to praise<br>
The pastures green, that meadow spreading wide:<br>
Let garments green not cede their dwelling place,<br>
Nor creatures bold their long-reigned land resign;<br>
For blocks upon them built are but disgrace<br>
—To Nature, and to Gaia's grand design.<br>
And if by human's ruthless gears they made<br>
To conquer Nature—quench her gentle mien—<br>
Shall she be curb'd, against them do crusade!<br>
Arise, ye mountains, blooms and skies serene:<br>
Like Men should fight for right and truth do fight<br>
With thy great might—till day o'erlay thy night.
