It had been with a beating and happy heart (as seen in my former blog [https://blog.knowscount.com/summer-vacation/](https://blog.knowscount.com/summer-vacation/)), that I had passed up the doorsteps (albeit there being none) and entered a lift to my home on a morning in early June; whereafter approaching the door to this hushed familiar temple, wherein I was to take Summer silently and seperated from this wondrous world. My solitude has been kindly lent to me by my father, because of whom our family had been quarantined.

It might, from the context, be detected that I am not satisfied for being quarantined and being stuck at home; whereas it is apparent fact that, if you happen to possess the correct information about me, staying at home all day long should suffices me very well —it was in sooth a wonderful reconciliation: how I indeed luxuriated myself in Brandes' multitudinous talks on european literature, in Chateaubriand's *Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe* (shame how I hadn't the chance to have a tasteful of the steak named after him), and in short yet wholesome history of the States.

The days after quarantine also had their charms. The very first day after quarantine had opened with a restless picturesque morning of gusty sunshine and oppressively low clouds, hanging in the heaven, as if they were to fall. And soon they did. Summer rains—dancing spirits of the skies—did lightly swiftly fall. Closing my laptop, I realised the *à propos* of singing birds has no more than a thing to tell—it was time for me to step out. 

The air is warm as your love's cheek, golden as canary. *Golden?* not the finest word for summer. Leave it be—an odd colour is meant for a special summer. I proceeded to pace, out of my temple, out of the complexes, out of my mind.

Sententious people are fond of telling us that we change entirely every seven years, that in that time every single atomy in our bodies, the carbon or some similar atoms of that sort, finds a substitute. I, nevertheless, am of opinion that we change way sooner and oftener, that rather we are at most weekly in our constitution. I, for one, do. Never have I ever enjoyed going out, pacing steadily amid nature's humid fog. Or perhaps my atoms were still whilst I was the one who changed?—As, say, a man who ate only plain rice for some two weeks would presumably find a slice of bread breath-takingly beautiful.

A slice of bread? Think of the degradation! The spacious morning of windswept sunshine, with a cozy bite in the keen air—warm—warm and cozy; now but a hasteful bite in the rough cheap bread. Ay, I should work on my rhetoric more indeed.
