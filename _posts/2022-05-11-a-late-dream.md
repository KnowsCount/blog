*was it a vision, or a waking dream?<br>
fled is that music:—do I wake or sleep?<br>
—Keats*

She shut her eyes upon her bed,<br>
And beauty glows about;<br>
The beam of glamour 'round her head,<br>
A bard could only doubt.<br>

She lays on bed a nakèd wise:<br>
And I am standing by;<br>
—To feel the wishes in her eyes<br>
The world I would defy.<br>

The head upon my shoulder seeks<br>
To think it carefully;<br>
But lo!—how blushful are her cheeks:<br>
I lay down carelessly.<br>

Her damask lips grow fairer still<br>
—Like cherry dews herself;<br>
The soft white bosom, like a hill,<br>
Is plump upon this elf.<br>

The eyes of ink, and hair of silk<br>
Have found their place on me;<br>
Complexion hers is white as milk,<br>
My eyesight leaves not she.<br>

The falls of ink upon her head<br>
Doth flow like inmost dream:<br>
—the lock of hair that half abed<br>
How sleek and smooth doth seem!<br>

Her eyes emit voracious lust,<br>
A lust that I obey:<br>
For with an ardour full robust,<br>
Beside her I do lay.<br>

My arms then 'round her breasts doth twine<br>
And mouth agapèd wide;<br>
My hands then claspèd 'round the shrine<br>
Behind her bras unti'd.<br>

Her legs curl upwards slightly bent,<br>
And gapeth wide apart;<br>
She nods her head and gave consent<br>
For me to make a start.<br>

I hold her hands and grab her knee,<br>
As quick as light'ning's leap;<br>
But looking up I see not she:<br>
A shadow nigh me creep.<br>

My mind then mocks my boyishness:<br>
I was in dreamland deep!<br>
That little nymph who dwells in me<br>
Had lullèd me asleep!<br>

I open my unwilling eyes<br>
Towards the rising beam:<br>
If I should die with her anigh<br>
—How well such dying seem!<br>
