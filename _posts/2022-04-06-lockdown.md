title: "\U0001F972 Lockdown"

During the lockdown dull and dim,<br/>
I took a walk nearby;<br/>
Sipping a tea by glass’ brim,<br/>
Cars passèd by and by.<br/>

Unto the heavens clear and bright,<br/>
My spirit went with sight;<br/>
And did the beaming sun well-nigh<br/>
Heedfully hear my sigh?<br/>

Is it so that we o'ercame<br/>
Virus who sickens all?<br/>
Or is it so its fiery flame,<br/>
Has made our lives seem small?<br/>
