title: ⚰️ Epitaph of the Past

Surely at last, the fairies, the damp moon,<br>
Must leave its barrèd queendom; and now soon<br>
Shall Love and song die hand in hand together,<br>
Fade from the mainlands, from the mainstream coasts.<br>
Look not, O Drayd, you who dwell unseen;<br>
Look not, snapdragon, sunflower, sweet rose,<br>
Behold not this world where Hera unqueen'd:<br>
Lest once again, we think of her depose.<br>
Tender Romance! Thy winter soon will start,<br>
Fey miracle! Dissolve in rigmarole;<br>
O Dryad, the Nymphs! Dead and dust though thou art:<br>
Take me, and wither would you take my soul?<br>
