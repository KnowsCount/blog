title: On Seeing a Boston Ivy
---

Within the city's bustling node,<br>
I walk'd amongst the streets;<br>
I saw some trees along the road,<br>
Some leaves that from it sheets.

The trees doth grow in selfsame mien,<br>
Their gaps all two feet wide;<br>
The leaves doth dye a selfsame green,<br>
And trunks in same tint dyed.

I turn'd and saw a shrubbery,<br>
—A tamèd thing forlorn:<br>
Although its leaves were blubbery,<br>
Its liberty was shorn.

But there upon a metal wall,<br>
Grew green of varying hue:<br>
This rebel in the urban pall,<br>
Put on a zesty shew!

Its forelimb ripe and mighty clasp'd<br>
Around the modish wall:<br>
The valour grim wherewith it grasp'd,<br>
Is thrilling to recall.

No dainty blossoms gardens grow<br>
Can match thine ardent soul:<br>
O thou that thrives and for life plough<br>
My worship thy nerve stole!
