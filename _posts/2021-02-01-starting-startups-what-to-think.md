I have been working a lot on my project '[Fissure](http://fissure1.misasky.com)' recently and relentlessly whilst playing a quite important role in a startup Mount and Blade modding Studio Chronicles.

I've ergo gained some experiences in working on startup projects.

Firstly pitching. pitching is one of the most important aspect of your startup. No matter how great your ideas are, your startup is useless if you cannot convey it and you don't have any capital. If you cannot inspire people, your startup is more than useless.

> but wait what if I can make a product that doesn't require much capital?... and teamwork is not needed! I can totally handle backend, frontend, security, marketing, ~~HR (not needed)~~ by myself.

Well.. If you cannot convey your ideas to customers then you're not going to have any customers, and if you don't have any customers, then your startup is useless, still. Every single interaction relating to your startup will somehow require you to pitch it. Now that is why it is essential to perfect your pitch.

Easier said than done. Here are the seven questions you should answer as clearly as possible:

1. **What do you do?**

    Test your idea with _Email test_, that is, to send an email to a competent friend and ask him to re-explain to you with his own words, and if they can do that, you're golden! If you wish to, you can follow the following template:

    ```
    To: Competent Friend
    Subject: My Startup
    ---
    my startup is about **xyz** and it solves the problem of *abc* using *ijk*.
    ```

2. **How big is the market?**

    Inverstors look at Return on Invensment so if you don't have a market, they'll never invest, so you need a market. Do not make your market target too wide or too low... make it correct. You're only wasting one another's time if you are making up numbers.

3. **What's your progress?**

    Investors want to make sure you are actually doing something... so, what is possible in a given time frame?

4. **What's your unique insight?**

    Or, in some sense, what is your competitive advantage? How are you different from any other alike-products out there in the market? What makes it likely for your startup to suceed in the market?

5. **What's your bussiness model?**

    How are you to make money? Are you the 'grow fast think about money later' type or are you the 'making money right now' type of company? It's always wise to have a plan of attack when it comes to monetisation.

6. **Who's on your team?**

    What are your standards and credentials whose technical? Who's doing what? Is everyone useful? Are you as lean as possible? These are the questions to ask yourself all the time.

7. **What do you want?**

    The answer to this can be money, or simply to tell your mom you're actually doing something and you're not wasting her life-savings doing some paltry projects LOL.

With these in mind, you'll be able to do ten-second pitches to a five-minute presentation with demo.
