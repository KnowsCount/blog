title: 'Starting Startups: What to Ponder'
---

I have been working a lot on my project '[Fissure](http://fissure1.misasky.com)' recently and relentlessly. Also, I am in a startup Mount and Blade modding Studio Chronicles. 

These gave me some experience on startups.

Firstly, the pitch. The pitch is one of the most important aspect of your startup no matter how great your ideas are, if you cannot convey it, and you don't have any capital then your startup is useless. Plus, if you cannot inspire people, and you don't have a team already working for you, then your startup is more than useless.

> but wait what if I can make a product that doesn't require much capital?... and teamwork is not needed! I can totally handle backend, frontend, security, marketing, ~~HR~~ (not needed) by myself.

Well.. If you cannot convey your ideas to customers then you're not going to have any customers, and if you don't have any customers, then your startup is useless, still. Every single interaction relating to your startup will somehow require you to pitch it. Now that is why it is essential to perfect your pitch. 

Easier said than done. Here are the seven questions that you should answer as clearly as possible:

1. What do you do?
2. How big is the market?
3. What's your progress?
4. What's your unique insight?
5. What's your bussiness model?
6. Who's on your team?
7. What do you want?

With these in mind, you'll be able to do ten-second pitches to a five-minute presentation with demo.

I'll come back and go into details later.
