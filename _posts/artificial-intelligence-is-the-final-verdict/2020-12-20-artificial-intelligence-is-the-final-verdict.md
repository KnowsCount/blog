description: in this article I talked briefly about the whys and wherefores of artificial intelligence being the final verdict in future.

Devised by OpenAI and released this year, GPT-3, ‚Äòan autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model‚Äô (Language Models are Few-Shot Learners, Tom B. Brown et al 2020), achieved an astonishingly admirable aftermath on simulating human language usage.

Whilst a great advancement in technology, this also leads to the question: will robots finally outdo human beings in every aspect? Many negate the statement, however, I here would in fact agree.

Imagine, my friend, a cabby though you are, you, for years long, have been gawping deep into the constellations, blurring in and out of focus; yet AI, on the contrary, does nothing but safeguarding their costumer unto they reach the destination as speedy as possible. To wit, Artificial Intelligence is a much more effective labour replacement in these situations wherein creativity is less likely to be needed.

One, in this scenario, may predictably argue an experienced cabby would have the vital intuition which may safeguard their costumers in an unexpected situation. Be that as it may, these situations, firstly, has an extremely low rate of existence: AI are trained with divers situations wherein human beings can even make mistakes. Secondly, it is crucial to realise that the AI revolution is not just about computers getting faster and smarter; it is fuelled by breakthroughs in the life sciences and the social sciences as well. The better we understand the biochemical mechanisms that underpin human emotions, desires and choices, the better computers can become in analysing human behaviour, predicting human decisions, and replacing human drivers, bankers and lawyers.

‚ÄòThis means that AI can outperform humans even in tasks that supposedly demand ‚Äúintuition‚Äù.‚Äô Says Yuval Noah Harari (21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Chapter 2) ‚ÄòIf you think AI needs to compete against the human soul in terms of mystical hunches ‚Äì that sounds impossible. But if AI really needs to compete against neural networks in calculating probabilities and recognising patterns ‚Äì that sounds far less daunting.‚Äô

One may also argue those whose jobs depend partly on prior experiences like doctors would also be a hardship for AI to overcome, however, ‚ÄòMany doctors focus almost exclusively on processing information: they absorb medical data, analyse it, and produce a diagnosis.‚Äô (Where machines could replace humans‚Äîand where they can‚Äôt (yet), Michael Chui)

Alongside experience-needing jobs, the aforementioned creativity works, presumeably, also makes it difficult for AI to replace everyone. When we are evaluating art, according to Art Evaluation: How to Appreciate Art?we tend to judge it by how well it simulates ‚Äòan emotional response from the viewer‚Äô (Art Evaluation: How to Appreciate Art?, Editor Neil Collins). If so, what might happen once AI algorithms can train models to comprehend and manipulate human emotions better than Shakespeare, Keats or Beyonc√©?

For all those reasons mentioned above, I strongly believe Artificial Intelligence is the final verdict.
