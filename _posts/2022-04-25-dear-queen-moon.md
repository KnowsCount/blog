Raindrops fiercer<br>
Can never stop her:<br>
The rising of the<br>
Dear Queen Moon.

Sun hides thither,<br>
Birds chirp yonder,<br>
â€”all just for the<br>
Dear Queen Moon.<br>

Night grew darker,<br>
But glows all 'round her,<br>
For she is our<br>
Dear Queen Moon.

Watch her closer:<br>
Above the heather,<br>
Where stars 'round cluster<br>
Dear Queen Moon.

Many's lover,<br>
Than beauty fairer;<br>
Selene we hight her:<br>
Dear Queen Moon.

Sing together,<br>
Dance forever;<br>
For we are under<br>
Dear Queen Moon.
