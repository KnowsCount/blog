I look at you and not a phrase<br>
Arises inside me:<br>
For not at all a human praise<br>
Could match that charm of thee.

I look at you and, smiling, you<br>
Dost look back unto me;<br>
Such rendezvous of sights of two,<br>
Makes souls in shyness flee!

'I dreamt of thee: O, dost thou know,<br>
And didst thou dream of me?<br>
Then didst thee dreaming true love show,<br>
And hath I shown mine thee?'

You blush, I smile, as I am thrilled<br>
To hear you answer me:<br>
You smiled as well, like sea distilled,<br>
One hears no speech from thee.

Your lips were still but dear eyes thine<br>
Didst sing your love to me:<br>
'Indeed—' they grinned 'this heart of mine<br>
With love does pound for thee.

'I saw you under nooks and leaves,<br>
Awaiting none but me—<br>
Same sickness of sweet love conceives,<br>
That I should dream of thee.

'I miss you true, and love you too,<br>
You own this heart in me:<br>
For now I dwell in thought of you<br>
And kiss's shall set me free.'

And thus I kissed you on your cheeks<br>
Just like you kissèd me:<br>
And there my tears ran two long creeks,<br>
Just like the tears of thee.
