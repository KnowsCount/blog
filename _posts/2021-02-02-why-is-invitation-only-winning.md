Recently, a new invitation-only app [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com) appeared in the market and had a huge triumph along with another invitation-only email app [Hey](https://hey.com). That makes me wonder: why is invitation-only strategy winning?

The first triumph of invitation-only strategies that I am aware of is the case of [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com/) (and there is a hardship distinguishing whether that success had anything to do with its initial invite-only policy or other factors XD). You might also recall [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) was born for a finite group of audiences, perhaps for some of the same reasons one might institute an invite-only policy. Some other exemplars that were once invitation-only I know of are [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com), [Medium](http://www.medium.com/), etc. (note: all mentioned above are not invitation-only anymore).

The recent examples are Clubhouse (by [Alpha Exploration Co](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/alpha-exploration-co/id1481002987), initially released in April 2020) and Hey (by [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), initially realeased in June 2020). Both of them achieved a huge success as startups, and I am, in the next few paragraphs, going to provide you with some basic information about these two products.

### Hey

Hey is the first thing because it is considered to be more **'conventional'**. Why so? Invitation-only used to be a marketing strategy for email companies. For instance, Gmail. Gamil went viral, so viral that some were selling Gmail invites on eBay (same thing with Hey and Clubhouse invites for hundreds of dollars [(case 1)](https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1356102192285900801) [(case 2)](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272885291624226816?lang=en)).

### Clubhouse

It is Clubhouse that motivated me to write this blog; it is also Clubhouse that motivated me to do the research and thus found Hey... So remember to say thanks to Alpha Exploration, Basecamp!

Right, back to the topic, the really interesting thing about Clubhose is how it uses the invitation-only system to basically build exclusivity, virtually like it's a **private circle** wherein you have to know somebody as to join and thereby increased the value of the invitation and, as most of us desire to see that which we've been missing out on, makes it more likely for people to fight for the invitation. **Clubhouse took that to the extreme**: I still haven't seen my invitation yet.

So, why, after all, is this strategy successful, then? What makes it different from all other marketing models?

If you would conclude that which I said above, invitation-only succeeded for the fact that it conveys a sense, albeit possibly forged, of exclusiveness, and most of us get a hard on for that kind of thing.

Moreover, there stands one huge strength of invitation-only apps: **it ensures quality**.

Quoting [Josh Steimle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshsteimle/),

> Invite only isn’t a zero-sum game. On our social networking site there is a strong content creation component, not unlike with Medium. And as Medium does we could opt to invite only certain users to have an account and create content on the site, while others would only have access to view content on the site. Or we could allow all users to create accounts and “like”, “favorite”, or “follow” content and content producers, while content creation itself would still be temporarily restricted.

Hence, invitation-only could be a representative of **higher quality**, as not all people can in this case write on the platform.

**So... Anyone willing to give me a Clubhouse invitation?**
