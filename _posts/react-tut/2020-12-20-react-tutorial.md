Hi! This is basically the first blog post here – a brief introduction of a future-updating series of ReactJS (hereinafter React) tutorial. I formerly used Wordpress to [blog](https://docs.knowscount.cc) but now I switched here onto [GitHub](https://github.com/KnowsCount/blog), using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a much nicer and much more seamless blogging environment. So, many thanks to GitHub and developers of Jekyll!

my React projects / React projects I contributed to:

[Storage Management System](https://github.com/KnowsCount/NKCS-Storage)

-   a project made for school storage managemnet.. collabrated with a back-end developer.

[WeeBlog](https://github.com/KnowsCount/WeeBlog)

-   a project under development. It is going to be, quoting myself in its description,

[hackchat](https://github.com/hack-chat/hackchat-client)

-   a rather novel online chat web app written in React. Quoting the [author](https://github.com/marzavec), it is

##### Now enough advertising, let's get to the topic.

## Story

React, my most used framework in front-end development and my favourite one, had a vastly speedy development since 2013 – the year Facebook opened its source (if you want, you can read a [2013 post](https://React.org/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html) about the reason why Facebook built React). Facebook did an awesome job maintaining and upgrading React... The newest [React v17.0](https://React.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html) released in this October (20 October, 2020) is an exemplary case.

Many tech giants in China I know are using this framework, for instance, Alibaba (taobao), NetEase, Zhihu, etc.; globally, companies like Facebook (of course), Instagram, Airbnb, Discord, etc. are also using React.

Along with the usage of tech giants, many new technologies are produced based on React. For example, [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) & [React VR](https://facebook.github.io/react-360).

React, however, is somewhat strange. One can actually learn the method to using the tool in a few hours, but it would be very hard for one to claim themselves mastering the framework. During all my time learning React, I've met many difficulties (which helped me to realise the fact that I am very stupid), and I shall hereby share some of them with you, so as to save more of your precious time.

There is also a framework named ['VueJS'](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), developed by a Chinese developer [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) which I only use to bootstrap small projects like my [portfolio](https://github.com/KnowsCount/portfolio). It has actually more stars on GitHub than react **(stars, not popularity)**.

## Announcement

This will be a series on my blog, I plan to try update it at least once per week, because for many a year, we have known that the best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else:

> While we teach, we learn,

said the Roman philosopher Seneca.

However, in this post I would start by telling you the basic skills one need in order to make the most out of this tutorial:

## Prerequisites

-   Comparatively good Javascript skills (`this`, for instance)
-   basic understanding of ES6 grammar
-   webpack _(optional)_
-   npm _(optional)_

OK. that would be it. Also, I personally recommand [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) as a self-teaching site. **This is not an advertisement.**
