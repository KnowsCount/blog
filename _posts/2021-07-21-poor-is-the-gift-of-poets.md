Poor is the gift of poets:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; nothing but words!<br />
The gifts of Kings are gold,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; silver, and laudation do incur;<br />
Garments of strange soft silk,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Feathers of wonderous birds;<br />
Steeds that are white as milk,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cattles grouped in herds.<br />
These are the gifts of the Kings:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet the gift that a poet brings,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; is nothing but words.<br />

Many a thousand words whereas!<br />
Take themâ€”a gift that flies alas!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; words that could have been birds,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; words that are burning in mirth,<br />
In the great eternal earth.<br />
Many a thousand words!<br />
Many a thousand worlds!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; â€”out of one poet's birth.<br />
