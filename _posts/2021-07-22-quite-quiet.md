<p style="padding-left:3rem; font-weight: 600">And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?  —Matthew 21 – 16, KJV</p>

I must, sadly yet inevitably, admit to Jesus that I have never, nor had the chance to, finish Psalm, and therefore, Psalm 8:2. Whereas must I? No wonder admitting one's lack of knowledge and being humble is a great virtue, praised by all those virturous and valiant; yet supposing one of the priests and scribes knows, like me, not what Psalm 8:2 was about, should he, whilst all other nodding, with a smile, say *'I have never.'* So began to jig and jingle my wonders as in Bible this morn I read.

The question is, from time to time, asked 'how poeticule talk?' One like me, however, is at loggerhead with the manifestation of this question—I would evince emotions of the other way around when, albeit more idealistic, 'Ought poeticule talk?' For there be no more wearing demand than that of compulsory—better educational—conversation.

The grandeurs of our world is quiet, as an exemplar. Never do the honeysuckles and roses grow nattering about their *à-propos*; never did an old book that my great grandfather once used as a privy talk about its past until my mother saw me holding it; the pompous Great Wall of China never did flute nothing about the people, whilst building it, who deceased. What, then, would happen if they do talk? There, in their proper context, dear readers, are many a man of charisma and charm: the nightingales would no longer sing to Keats about *the weariness, the fever and the fret*, but of found worms—now never would we, by any chance, quote 'Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!' but call it a *shrieking harbinger* like wise Shakespeare did; irksome would the giggles of morning stars would sound when with awestruck antiphony we stand with the citizens of Verona to gaze, and to witness, the death of two young lovers. How very generous of Artemis for her beings are so silent!—They, at the very least, make no more sound than the tall primeval trees rocking 'eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound.'

'There is a silence where hath been no sound,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a silence where no sound may be,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the cold grave — under the deep, deep sea,<br />
Or in wide desert where no life is found,<br />
Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound;'

Maybe my writers are like the Old Testament’s heroes of faith, of whom the writer of Hebrews says, “that they without us should not be made perfect” (Hebrews 11:40, KJV). Is that what they see in me, and is that why they published? Are they watching me now?

the rest is WIP
