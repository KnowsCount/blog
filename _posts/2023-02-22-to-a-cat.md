A cat lays slumb'ring here and there,<br>
Her dwellings never fix'd.<br>
No masters rule her leapings fair,<br>
Nor cat food for her mix'd.

She lays herself upon the ground<br>
Of dirt or concrete made;<br>
'Twas in the bushes that I'd found<br>
Her body in the shade.

O, with what zest and with what heart,<br>
I sat beside her lay:<br>
And read divine Erato's art<br>
To this delightful fay.

Her back was arch'd, yet she with mien<br>
Of gentle duchess stroll'd<br>
Towards the sun, such that I ween<br>
She'd scorn my readings old.

She never did: she sat and made<br>
My worries provèd wrong:<br>
Beneath the sun, without the shade,<br>
She listened to my song.

The soul whereby her being's form'd,<br>
O hear me I thee pray!—<br>
Wert thou from Muse or God transform'd<br>
I could not but be gay.
