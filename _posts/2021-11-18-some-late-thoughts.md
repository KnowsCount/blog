So soon tired!—how very lively was I,<br>
When I played, frolicked and on sky did fly,<br>
But now when I shall lie on bed and think,<br>
All left were memories. And stars do blink,<br>
At my weary eyes, which stared and gazed<br>
At the heavenly bodies half-embraced:<br>
That dwelled for aeons, older than Titans,<br>
Older than we; the sky they enlightens,<br>
Still changes its colours, but nought of me<br>
Can alter myself, as strength cease to be,<br>
On my body. O love thou art poor alas!<br>
—But lo! Thou art the fortune I amass.<br>
The blood and sweat I wept away today,<br>
Makes the lady in dreams my singing fay.<br>
