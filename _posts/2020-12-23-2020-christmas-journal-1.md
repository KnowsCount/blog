Iâ€™ve done a few things this week and shall hereby record them.

I have, firstly, started this blog.

### Coding

I also kept making contributions to GitHub over the past â€¦ well, more than a month.

I have created, and contributed to a few repositories, too. I, for instance, contributed to the [new client](https://github.com/hack-chat/hackchat-client) of [hack chat](https://hack.chat) (it looks like [this](https://beta.hack.chat)), a minimal, distraction-free chat app (though it somewhat caused more [internationalisation issues](https://github.com/hack-chat/hackchat-client/issues/30)); started a ReactJS tutorial page; fixed a fatal [bug](https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/issues/1) on the beta-version project [NKCS Storage System](https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage) (the current fatal issues are the potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies); sketched the basic [framework (outline)](https://github.com/KnowsCount/WeeBlog) of the [WeeBlog](https://weeblog.knowscount.vercel.app/) project, 'a beauteous content sharing platform solution orchestrated to be sexy and concise'; made a simple [photo-wall](https://github.com/KnowsCount/yuanyuan) for one of my cyber-security friend under his request as his birthday is approaching; forked and changed some bit of the project [logoly](https://github.com/KnowsCount/logoly) which is not appropriate for one to describe here.

I am also shifting from using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as my node package manager (even though npm stands for node package manager) to Facebook's [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). I know, I don't like [Zuckerberg](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Mark-Zuckerberg-so-hated), and I [don't like Facebook](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-not-like-to-use-Facebook). But what can I do?â€“ My favourite [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) is developed by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/react) and `yarn` is just great.

### Books

I, under the demand of my Chinese teacher, finished a part of _The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su DongPo_ wherein the word Gay is used the old-fashioned way. Fun fact: this book is a masterpiece writ by a Chinese writer named Lin Yutang, yet it was an English book â€“ the version I am reading is translated into Chinese.

As for my English homework, I have been reading _The prisoner of Zenda_. I planned to read Edgar Allan Poe's at first, but has given up.

### Homework

I have done my Chinese homework but the reading part; a part of Maths homework. I plan to finish the poster and therefore Science homework today (on 23 Dec).

### Video Games

Two days ago I played video games the whole morning, and nothing remarkable happened. It was that evening when I. intentionally, deleted a Europa Universalis `savegame` which I spent tens of hours on... I was Great Britain in the savegame, and was therefore too strong, and the game thereby became boring.

### Telly Shows

I started watching _Silicon Valley_ again â€“ the third time, also the funeral episode of _The IT crowd_ which I watched over and over for a few million times.
