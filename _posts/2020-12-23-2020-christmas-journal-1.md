I’ve done a few things this week. 

I have, firstly, started this blog.
### Coding

I also kept making contributions to GitHub over the past … well, more than a month.

I have created, and contributed to a few repositories, too. I, for instance, contributed to the [new client](https://github.com/hack-chat/hackchat-client) of [hack chat](https://hack.chat) (it looks like [this](https://beta.hack.chat)), a minimal, distraction-free chat app (though it somewhat caused more [internationalisation issues](https://github.com/hack-chat/hackchat-client/issues/30)); started a ReactJS tutorial page; fixed a fatal [bug](https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/issues/1) on the beta-version project [NKCS Storage System](https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage) (the current fatal issues are the potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies); sketched the basic [framework (outline)](https://github.com/KnowsCount/WeeBlog) of the [WeeBlog](https://weeblog.knowscount.vercel.app/) project,  'a beauteous content sharing platform solution orchestrated to be sexy and concise'; made a simple [photo-wall](https://github.com/KnowsCount/yuanyuan) for one of my cyber-security friend under his request as his birthday is approaching; forked and changed some bit of the project [logoly](https://github.com/KnowsCount/logoly) which is not appopriate to describe.

### Books
I, under the demand of my Chinese teacher, finished a part of *The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su DongPo* wherein the word Gay is used the old-fashioned way. Fun fact: this book is a masterpiece writ by a Chinese writer named Lin YuTang, yet it was an English book – the version I am reading is translated into Chinese. 

As for my English homework, I have been reading *The prisoner of Zenda*. I planned to read Edgar Allan Poe's at first, but has given up. 

### Homework
I have done my Chinese homework but the reading part; a part of Maths homework. I plan to finish the poster and therefore Science homework today (on 23 Dec).

### Video Games
Two days ago I played video games the whole morning, and nothing remarkable happened. It was that evening when I. intentionally, deleted the a Europa Universalis `savegame` which I spent tens of hours on... I was Great Britain in the savegame, and was therefore too strong, and the game thereby became boring. 

### Telly Shows
I started watching *Silicon Valley* again – the third time, also the funeral episode of *The IT crowd* which I watched over and over for a few million times.
