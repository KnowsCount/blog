The breeze, albeit mild, has long dandled daffodils; the sun, albeit glaring, has long flickered aground. 

A genteel country maid greedy of flowers wandered amid the alien corns, and pressed the vivid petals whereon diamond-dews rests tenderly.

It was halfway through springtime, mid-time of auspiciousness. The pines tall and erect are dotted with countless tiny sparks of greenish-brown, which will in short blaze up the wild hedgerow; yet this untimely eyeless man has placed himself in yon beauteous elms.

Eyeless! I know whereof I speak, 'tis precisely this eyelessly blind man, whom lies and dreams with the light-winged Dryad of the trees. He, weariness-wrecked, was in a dream – a wintry dream golden.

That night the blind man dreamt that he was blind.

Interlocking muscles on his face, drunk with fatigue, are trembling and shivering, under sharp and everlasting pain. Then, awakened by powder shells dropping gently before him, he quickly stood up and ran off deep into the woods, far away from the once melodious birds on fire. 

*All of us die.* he thought, *the Krauts and us British lads. And even the birds.*

His case is simple and standard. His company rumoured about all the lads going blind, thus he began to wonder, to imagine, what it would be like if he, likewise, goes blind; he then closed his eyes to try it and when he was finally able to reopen it, he was already blind. This is why he has no name – blind man doesn't need a name, he is his voice. 

*Therefore it doesn't matter now.* He said to himself, *All of us goes blind after we die.*

Whereas now he cowered, for he heard some men, perched upon their blade, along with the loud drones of machinery. 

*However, to everything its proper season, just because you rise early does not mean that you will die sooner. Therefore I shall keep myself alive.* He nodded as he pondered. He, thus, started going backward into the woods wherein the fresh shells lie. The guards, however, saw him. 

The guards ranted, roared and chased. They were Englishmen. I can assure you, the blindest of them all is not the eyeless blind man, he is but the firing guard. 

But 'twas all but a dream before his death. Out of the five battalions that fought on the fields, there wasn't anyone who truely witnessed the hideous state of the dead man's body, the face and skull blown to smithereens by the gunshots, three holes where bullets had penetrated the neck and the region of the breastbone; nor was there anyone who saw the last smile: *I don't think we did go blind, I think we are blind, Blind but seeing, Blind people who can see, but do not see*. 

The dew evaporated, the petals dried, the country-maid plucked the flower, touching the moistureless petals with her fingers – a vivid life can become such a weakling after being abandoned.
