title: The Fallacy of Being 'Apolitical'
---

It is, I am given to understand, no new nor profound knowledge that everything in human world is, to some degree, political. Politics, at the root level, is just opinions whereby one endeavours to derive policy from; therefore, just like a living human being cannot 'have no opinion', he cannot be 'whole-heartedly apolitical'. A parallel apparent truth is that all men, however isolated from society, remains a social animal; and again cannot be entirely apolitical. For, however he who dwells in the innermost of the wilderness should shun it, the very act of isolating himself by escaping society and politics is one of the purest and most symbolic political acts.

Whereas from that which I observe lately many do not believe so. They fail to remember—often deliberately—this most familiar axiom of human nature, which should have been rooted-deeply already in every one of our souls since Aristotle, at least.

The aforementioned forgetfulness often involves the notion of fitting oneself in *status quo*; that is, to remark nothing upon the inconstant phantasmagorias that should soon pass as a dream before you: work nothing out of it, reflect nothing upon the matter, better see nothing of it, and most importantly keep the, as the old proverb goes, 'golden silence'. These very sound words may be deemed sagacious and learned till we should examine their emptiness—what, for instance, is all this rigmarole about facing the changes of modern world with no reactions but a more pompous way of phrasing conservatism? how, I ask, is all this gibberish about keeping silent better than 'don't ask, don't tell'?

To say that 'I am apolitical', is nothing less political than saying 'I stand with Ukraine'—for it is indeed opinions and statements which construct politics, and the assertion above is both.
