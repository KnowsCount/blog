I am—and when I say 'I am', I must be taken seriously—the nicest person I had the hap to know upon the planet earth. I was dining in a Burger King somewhere around the school before I should enter it, and I recalled how a roommate kindly bought us KFC last week. Thoughts and feelings arise, and I decided to buy each of them milk tea—or, according to their preferences, hot chocolate. Now that I should write it down, actually, the KFC guy seems to be the kinder—but still, I am the kindest.

Nothing else notable today—or is there? My brain does not really want to work.
