In boredom I have found a shrine,<br>
A temple rich and wide:<br>
My Muses come and heart of mine<br>
Is fill'd with Poesy's tide.

Behind its garments strange and fine,<br>
A million words I see—<br>
The produce of dear dance and wine<br>
Makes me know nought but glee.

I find myself in Windermere<br>
Among the greatest minds,<br>
Their wisdom spreads o'er here and there<br>
My soul its own joy finds.

I see all dancing daffodils<br>
As Wordsworth did describe;<br>
And 'mongst Blake's dark Satanic mills,<br>
The workers I inscribe.

And here I stand before a cot<br>
In Milton's paradise;<br>
'Tis lost or gain'd I careth not:<br>
The sight of it suffice!

I see aw'd Chatterton asleep,<br>
And, right above his eyes,<br>
From out his hair a garland seep,<br>
Of laurel twigs comprise.

His face is still, serene and cold:<br>
As cold as his poor fate;<br>
His lips—where Genius did unfold<br>
Yet murmurs high debate.

[should be continued till I am bored again...]
