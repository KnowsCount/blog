It is curious fact that, albeit exciting, we got the chance to enter the Yale round. I (and when I say I, I must be understood to be speaking dramatically) only venture to evince pride once per century; and I do reckon our achievements in World Scholars Cup does make me quite proud—of myself, and of course, the team.

Life itself, according to Mr Meredith, 'is but a little holding, lent / to do a mighty labour.' Indeed, we, a few little holdings, as Mr Owen would describe it, 'trudged through sludge'—the sludge of all provided academic information and challenges we met during the tournament, and our mightily did labour into the very last round—the round wherein the world shall compete—the Tournament of Champions.

The trip itself, to put it in a way that is no exaggeration for me, is perfect. My measure of all academic trips, though, is more about, rather than about the academic part—I never fancied Coeus—the fun. We had pizza parties, and Scholar's Bowl where we danced and ranted and roared. The fun, however, does not disappear when we had the chance to write, to answer, and to debate; to wit: the competition has powerfully breathed into all the studies the unifying breath of life.

To end my platitude above, I would like to use a sentence of, not from one of those aforementioned giants, mine in the very first round of debate of this tournament—"dream mightily and do bravely" as by doing so you could, like us, win yourself facts far-fetched.
