title: "✉️ A Note to Emily"

*a meagre attempt on dactylic composition.*

When should I see in a bower your eyes<br>
In which dances the spirit who from our love rise,<br>
Whereby all of your feelings shall sweetly express,<br>
From which love-sicken'd teardrops shall run like your tress.

What be the number of hours I wait<br>
Till I see in my sight that dear bed where you sate,<br>
Whereon you and your sorrows doth vanish away,<br>
And in dreaming we meet and I ever will stay.
