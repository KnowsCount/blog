title: "\U0001F680 Summer Vacation!"
---

Today our summer vacation starts. Aye, most brilliant of all vacations, summer vacation.

I shall dine and sleep and frolic; I shall live and die and revive. 'We'll rant and we'll roar, like true _Schoolish bastards_, we'll rant and we'll roar, all along the _salt  beeves_, until we strike soundings in the _monde de joie_.'

Aye, aye! What joy, what fun! 'season of mists and mellow fruitfulness?' Nay, that be nothingâ€”for god bless the season of Apollo, the eye of heaven; and god bless the season of us, the students, the most joyous of men!

_He has his Summer, when luxuriously<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he loves<br>
To ruminate, and by such dreaming high<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves'_
