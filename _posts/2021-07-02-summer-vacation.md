title: "\U0001F680 Summer Vacation!"
---

Today begins our summer vacation. Ay, the vacation greater than all of the great of the world—the great vacation of summer.

I shall dine and sleep and frolic; I shall live and die and revive. 'We'll rant and we'll roar, like true _Schoolish bastards_, we'll rant and we'll roar, all along the _salt beeves_, until we strike soundings in the _monde de joie_ of our minds.'

Ay, ay! What fun, what joy! 'season of mists and mellow fruitfulness?' Nay Mr Keats, that be nothing—did your _'light winged of the trees'_ not _'singest of summer in full throated ease?'_ O God bless the season of Apollo, that eye of heaven; and god bless the season of us, the students, the _discipulorum_, the _étudiants_, the most joyous of men!

_Summer, O summer, no winds from November;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For with scholastic freeze we dissever,<br>
And cease upon the midlands of some shining coasts.
<br><br>
Summer, O summer, no presents from December;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet with time God presents us, time to dismember,<br>
Time for me to devise my jolly boasts._
