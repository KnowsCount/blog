—*for it exhausts my spirit*

I bid thee farewell fair and well,<br>
Thou fiend in high estate:<br>
The ruthless mien wherewith you dwell,<br>
Gold you electroplate.<br>

Ere lilies within herbage hide,<br>
As wintry wind unfold;<br>
Songbirds songless on trees abide,<br>
Their grief and woe untold;<br>

Ere the wondrous world close its eyes<br>
—And poets miss their call,<br>
I challenge thee who torment me:<br>
Moles and molecules all.<br>

With fancies gazing spirits high,<br>
Thy carbon compounds die;<br>
And thine own deathbed drawing nigh<br>
—’Tis the triumph o’ faerie skies.<br>
