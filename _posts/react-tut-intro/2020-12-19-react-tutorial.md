Hi! This is basically the first blog post here – a brief introduction of a future-updating series of ReactJS (hereinafter React) tutorial. I formerly used WordPress to [blog](https://docs.knowscount.cc) but now I switched here onto [GitHub](https://github.com/KnowsCount/blog), using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a much nicer and much more seamless blogging environment. So, many thanks to GitHub and the developers of Jekyll!

some of my React projects / React projects I contributed to:

[Storage Management System](https://github.com/KnowsCount/NKCS-Storage)

-   a project made for school storage management.. collaborated with a back-end developer.

[WeeBlog](https://github.com/KnowsCount/WeeBlog)

-   a project under development. It is going to be, quoting myself in its description,

> a beauteous content sharing platform solution orchestrated to be sexy and concise.

_This is what we will be aiming for in the project part of the tutorial._

[hackchat](https://github.com/hack-chat/hackchat-client)

-   a rather novel online chat web app written in React. Quoting the [author](https://github.com/marzavec), it is

##### Now enough advertising, let's get to the topic.

## Story

React, my most-used framework in front-end development and my favourite one, had a highly speedy development since 2013 – the year Facebook opened its source (you can read a [2013 post](https://React.org/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html) about the reason why Facebook built React). Facebook did an awesome job maintaining and enhancing React... The newest [React v17.0](https://React.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html) released this October (20 October, 2020) is an very exemplary case.

Many tech giants in China I know are using this framework, for instance, Alibaba (Taobao), NetEase, Zhihu, etc.; globally, companies like Facebook (of course), Instagram, Airbnb, Discord, etc. are also using React.

Along with the usage of tech giants, many new technologies are produced based on React. For example, [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) & [React VR](https://facebook.github.io/react-360).

React, however, is somewhat strange. One can learn the to use it in a few hours, but it would be very hard for one to claim they has mastered the framework. During all my time learning React, I've met many difficulties (which helped me to realise the fact that I am very stupid), and I, in this blog, shall hereby share some of them with you.

There is also a framework named ['VueJS'](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), created by a Chinese developer [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) which I only use to bootstrap small projects like my [portfolio](https://github.com/KnowsCount/portfolio). It has actually more stars on GitHub than react **(stars, not popularity)**.

## Announcement

This will be a series on my blog, I plan to try update it at least once per week, because for many a year, we know the best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else, quoting the Roman philosopher Seneca:

> While we teach, we learn,

However, in this post I would start by telling you the basic skills one need in order to make the most out of this tutorial:

## Prerequisites

-   Comparatively good Javascript skills (`this`, for instance)
-   basic understanding of ES6 syntax
-   webpack _(optional)_
-   npm _(optional)_
-   Router _(optional)_

## What will I Teach?

I will divide the whole tutorial into three parts:

-   Basic React

    -   Environment
    -   Basic Syntax
    -   Concepts Explanation (Virtual DOM, Diff Algorithm, etc.)
    -   Animation

-   Redux

-   Making your own Project
    -   Header (kinda complex)
    -   HomePage
    -   About Page
    -   Login/Signup
    -   Deployment

## What will you Learn?

-   create-react-app
-   Component Thinking
-   JSX
-   Debugging
-   Virtual DOM
-   Diff Algorithm
-   Lifecycle
-   React-transition-group (third party animation module)
-   Redux
-   Antd
-   UI, Container Component
-   Stateless Component
-   redux-thunk, redux-saga
-   Styled-components
-   Immutable.js
-   redux-immutable
-   axios
-   ...
-   ...

In conclusion, after learning from this tutorial, you will be able to

-   **thoroughly comprehend** React
-   **entirely master** 'React Family' (react + redux + react-router + axios + antd)
-   do the front-end developement of **megaprojects**
-   code in **standard**
-   (whispering) **at least 100K a year**

OK. that would be it. Also, I personally recommend [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) as a self-teaching site. **This is not an advertisement.**
