Her dwellings never fix’d.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She lays herself upon the ground&lt;br /&gt;
Of dirt or concrete made;&lt;br /&gt;
‘Twas in the bushes that I’d found&lt;br /&gt;
Her body in the shade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O, with what zest and with what heart,&lt;br /&gt;
I sat beside her lay:&lt;br /&gt;
And read divine Erato’s art&lt;br /&gt;
To this delightful fay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her back was arch’d, yet she with mien&lt;br /&gt;
Of gentle duchess stroll’d&lt;br /&gt;
Towards the sun, such that I ween&lt;br /&gt;
She’d scorn my readings old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She never did: she sat and made&lt;br /&gt;
My worries provèd wrong:&lt;br /&gt;
Beneath the sun, without the shade,&lt;br /&gt;
She listened to my song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soul whereby her being’s form’d,&lt;br /&gt;
O hear me I thee pray!—&lt;br /&gt;

A temple rich and wide:&lt;br /&gt;
My Muses come and heart of mine&lt;br /&gt;
Is fill’d with Poesy’s tide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind its garments strange and fine,&lt;br /&gt;
A million words I see—&lt;br /&gt;
The produce of dear dance and wine&lt;br /&gt;
Makes me know nought but glee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself in Windermere&lt;br /&gt;
Among the greatest minds,&lt;br /&gt;
Their wisdom spreads o’er here and there&lt;br /&gt;
My soul its own joy finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see all dancing daffodils&lt;br /&gt;
As Wordsworth did describe;&lt;br /&gt;
And ‘mongst Blake’s dark Satanic mills,&lt;br /&gt;
The workers I inscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I stand before a cot&lt;br /&gt;
In Milton’s paradise;&lt;br /&gt;
‘Tis lost or gain’d I careth not:&lt;br /&gt;
The sight of it suffice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see aw’d Chatterton asleep,&lt;br /&gt;
And, right above his eyes,&lt;br /&gt;
From out his hair a garland seep,&lt;br /&gt;
Of laurel twigs comprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His face is still, serene and cold:&lt;br /&gt;
As cold as his poor fate;&lt;br /&gt;
His lips—where Genius did unfold&lt;br /&gt;
Yet murmurs high debate.&lt;/p&gt;

He lives in a very posh house, in a very posh complex—so posh that the security by the gate should know each and every name of the proprietors. Ignorant of that being a possibility, I exclaimed in awe—an exclamation which evidently caused the security to doubt whether ones of my friend’s poshness should know a man like myself. He made me call my friend so that he can make sure I am not a homeless boy trying to harass a rich man—which I pretty much am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called and my friend told the security he does know me—God bless him; the security lets me in, and I am once again awed: each house comes with a garden, and in the middle of the complex is a huge garden; trees can be found everywhere, whilst in the centre garden theres grows a literal forest of trees. I recall little about the various flowers upon the fresh lawns scatter, but I do remember well the trees. Almost every one of the trees I had the hap to meet along the way has its own voice as well as its feature: at the passing of the breeze the fir-trees sob and moan no less distinctly than they rock; the holly whistles as it battles with itself; the ash hisses amid its quiverings; the beech rustles whilst its flat boughs should rise and fall. I walked, in lieu of walking towards the house, into the trees, and soon found myself standing in the clearing amongst the centre trees. And apparently in a sea of mosquitos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly left, and into his mansion I went.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><category term="reflections" /><summary type="html">Homeless in Shanghai, I have to stay in my friend’s place for the weekend.

The evening studies, then, was supposed to be a traquil time for me to read and think; whereas—as I am writing this—the air conditioner produces a burning smell whilst classmates around me are screaming as if they are being burnt alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excitement and constant jabbering is fostered by a very sorry scene today. A lady—I am wont to address to females thus, though in this case I feel like I should hardly call her a lady—publicly took off her jacket in class, whereunder she is clothed with only—well—undergarment. I was sitting at the very front of the classroom when she did that—the teacher’s seat—and I, when I heard a scream, lifted my head and haplessly had a very brief glance at the… view. I quickly stuffed the book I was holding onto my face and swore—my brain has not the faintest idea of how to deal with this verily… delicate situation. I was nearly able to convince myself such drama is but a boyish phantasmagoria my brain had produced—nearly—till some other screams arose: she had turned around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mankind is quite strange a thing to think about; they in their shape and abilities resemble me, but their mind—the way they think—is oftentimes mystical. What was she—pray tell, thou All-knowing—thinking when she should do that? I was reading Keats when she had commited the deed, and now his words are but irony to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Surely the All-seeing, &lt;br /&gt;
Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would hardly, dear Lord Almighty, agree with such gift—it is no gift, and it is not to be agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

Keats is a genius. These are, alas, all my thoughts today. The first one new, the second old. Nought had left any impression worth mentioning except for the two: it’s yet another bland and boring day under the sun. Bland and boring may be too harsh two words to conclude a day though: after all, each day has its own uniqueness; today is but an example of a day that is lacking in its uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A song, though—it just came in mind—did stir my bored spirit today; the song did not quite impress me heretofore when I first listened, but today it did. Would you were bored as I am, you might try listening: the name is The Garden Where the Praities Grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expand on the dactyls bit: I have been composing poetry once more. The first line struck my mind out of nowhere, with a dactylic rhythm: ‘when should I see in a bower your eyes’. Thus the poem went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When should I see in a bower your eyes&lt;br /&gt;
In which dances the spirit who from our love rise,&lt;br /&gt;
Whereby all of your feelings shall sweetly express,&lt;br /&gt;
From which love-sicken’d teardrops shall run like your tress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What be the number of hours I wait&lt;br /&gt;
Till I see in my sight that dear bed where you sate,&lt;br /&gt;
Whereon you and your sorrows doth vanish away,&lt;br /&gt;
As in dreaming we meet and I ever will stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not good poetry: too evident some sacrifices are made for the fitting of the metre, yet it is at least a joy—for myself—to read. Now Byron is the genius of the day as well as Keats: one presently admires the first canto of The Bride of Abydos more than one has ever did.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><category term="reflections" /><summary type="html">Versification in dactyls is hard.
