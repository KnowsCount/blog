Arises inside me:&lt;br /&gt;
For not at all a human praise&lt;br /&gt;
Could match that charm of thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at you and, smiling, you&lt;br /&gt;
Dost look back unto me;&lt;br /&gt;
Such rendezvous of sights of two,&lt;br /&gt;
Makes souls in shyness flee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I dreamt of thee: O, dost thou know,&lt;br /&gt;
And didst thou dream of me?&lt;br /&gt;
Then didst thee dreaming true love show,&lt;br /&gt;
And hath I shown mine thee?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You blush, I smile, as I am thrilled&lt;br /&gt;
To hear you answer me:&lt;br /&gt;
You smiled as well, like sea distilled,&lt;br /&gt;
One hears no speech from thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your lips were still but dear eyes thine&lt;br /&gt;
Didst sing your love to me:&lt;br /&gt;
‘Indeed—’ they grinned ‘this heart of mine&lt;br /&gt;
With love does pound for thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I saw you under nooks and leaves,&lt;br /&gt;
Awaiting none but me—&lt;br /&gt;
Same sickness of sweet love conceives,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I miss you true, and love you too,&lt;br /&gt;
You own this heart in me:&lt;br /&gt;
For now I dwell in thought of you&lt;br /&gt;
And kiss’s shall set me free.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus I kissed you on your cheeks&lt;br /&gt;

fled is that music:—do I wake or sleep?&lt;br /&gt;
—Keats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She shut her eyes upon her bed,&lt;br /&gt;
And beauty glows about;&lt;br /&gt;
The beam of glamour ‘round her head,&lt;br /&gt;
A bard could only doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She lays on bed a nakèd wise:&lt;br /&gt;
And I am standing by;&lt;br /&gt;
—To feel the wishes in her eyes&lt;br /&gt;
The world I would defy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head upon my shoulder seeks&lt;br /&gt;
To think it carefully;&lt;br /&gt;
But lo!—how blushful are her cheeks:&lt;br /&gt;
I lay down carelessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her damask lips grow fairer still&lt;br /&gt;
—Like cherry dews herself;&lt;br /&gt;
The soft white bosom, like a hill,&lt;br /&gt;
Is plump upon this elf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eyes of ink, and hair of silk&lt;br /&gt;
Have found their place on me;&lt;br /&gt;
Complexion hers is white as milk,&lt;br /&gt;
My eyesight leaves not she.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The falls of ink upon her head&lt;br /&gt;
Doth flow like inmost dream:&lt;br /&gt;
—the lock of hair that half abed&lt;br /&gt;
How sleek and smooth doth seem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her eyes emit voracious lust,&lt;br /&gt;
A lust that I obey:&lt;br /&gt;
For with an ardour full robust,&lt;br /&gt;
Beside her I do lay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My arms then ‘round her breasts doth twine&lt;br /&gt;
And mouth agapèd wide;&lt;br /&gt;
My hands then claspèd ‘round the shrine&lt;br /&gt;
Behind her bras unti’d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her legs curl upwards slightly bent,&lt;br /&gt;
And gapeth wide apart;&lt;br /&gt;
She nods her head and gave consent&lt;br /&gt;
For me to make a start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hold her hands and grab her knee,&lt;br /&gt;
As quick as light’ning’s leap;&lt;br /&gt;
But looking up I see not she:&lt;br /&gt;
A shadow nigh me creep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind then mocks my boyishness:&lt;br /&gt;
I was in dreamland deep!&lt;br /&gt;
That little nymph who dwells in me&lt;br /&gt;
Had lullèd me asleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Politics, at the root level, is just opinions whereby one endeavours to derive policy from; therefore, just like a living human being cannot ‘have no opinion’, he cannot be ‘whole-heartedly apolitical’. A parallel apparent truth is that all men, however isolated from society, remains a social animal; and again cannot be entirely apolitical. For, however he who dwells in the innermost of the wilderness should shun it, the very act of isolating himself by escaping society and politics is one of the purest and most symbolic political acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas from that which I observe lately many do not believe so. Some fail to remember—often deliberately—this most familiar axiom of human nature, which should have been rooted-deeply already in every one of our souls since Aristotle, at least. A late exemplar can be easily seen should you go to websites of &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org&quot;&gt;React.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt; and so forth—an often criticised banner can be seen: ‘Support Ukraine 🇺🇦, Help Provide Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine. ‘ it says. The criticisers claim that tech should be free from politics, thus such act of trying to help victims of war out is to be condemned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, then, if one must not participate in political activities, how does he achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the sound reasoning of why organisations must not express their political views from criticisers, their answer to this questions is yet simple: be blind. The aforementioned forgetfulness often involves the notion of disregarding reality; that is, to remark nothing upon the inconstant phantasmagorias that should soon pass as a dream before you: work nothing out of it, reflect nothing upon the matter, better see nothing of it, and most importantly keep the, as the old proverb goes, ‘golden silence’. These very sound arguments may be deemed sagacious and learned till we should examine their emptiness—what, for instance, is all this rigmarole about facing the changes of modern world with no reactions but a more pompous way of phrasing conservatism? how, I ask, is all this gibberish about keeping silent better than ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that ‘I am apolitical’, is nothing less political than saying ‘I stand with Ukraine’—for it is indeed opinions and statements which construct politics, and the assertion above is both.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">It is, I am given to understand, no new nor profound knowledge that everything in human world is, to some degree, political.
