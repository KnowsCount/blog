&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that is a pronoun referring back to a noun phrase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;which is the relative pronoun used for inanimate antecedents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to put it simply, in ‘a be that which c [verb]’, that refers to ‘a’, whilst ‘which’ refers to ‘that’. for instance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a very small part of acting is that which takes place on stage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is the same as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a very small part of acting is acting which takes place on stage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which equates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a very small part of acting is what takes place on stage (..informal)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the ones who does not like the usage of ‘which’, ‘that which’ can also be ‘that that’: ‘the latent opposition to rearming Germany is as strong as that that has found public expression.’ (from ‘The Careful Writer’ by Per Bernstein, ‘Let it be noted that there are two exceptions to the use of that to introduce a defining clause. One is a situation in which the demonstrative that and the relative that come together, as in this sentence: …[the example from above]… ‘, ‘the second exception is a situation in which the relative follows a preposition: for example, of which, not of that.’)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some definitions that might help&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inanimate&quot;&gt;inanimate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘inanimate’ (or ‘non-animate’, ‘non-personal’): not being, and never having been alive. grammatically, an inanimate noun or pronoun have no referent that includes a human, animal, plant or other entity which is considered alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inanimate-whose&quot;&gt;inanimate whose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a fun thing to mention here is ‘inanimate whose’ (whose inanimate, non-personal whose, and neuter whose): whose indicates that the antecedent has a possessive role in the relative clause (‘the man whose daughter I married’), but it can also refer to things as well as animate objects (‘I found a car whose battery was dead’); the use of the inanimate whose dates from the 15th century, but since the 18th century has drawn criticism from those who consider whose to be the genitive (possessive) only of the relative pronoun who and therefore believe it should be restricted to personal antecedents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the preferred substitute is of which the, which I find clumsy and overly formal (as in ‘that’s the car of which the alarm keeps waking us up at night.’). The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language emphasises it is perfectly grammatical (‘genitives … are completely grammatical and by no means exceptional’, pp. 1049–1050).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;examples&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I could a tale unfold whose lightest word / Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, (Hamlet I.v)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;or&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes / Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows. (Two Gentlemen of Verona, III.ii)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;or&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And they said; Goe to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. (Genesis 11:4, KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;antecedents&quot;&gt;antecedents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘antecedents’: an expression that gives its meaning to a proform (pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adverb, etc.). such as the her in ‘tina did her homework’, as the pronoun ‘her’ refers to and takes meaning from ‘tina’.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">‘that which’</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">😶 Some Late Thoughts</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/some-late-thoughts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="😶 Some Late Thoughts" /><published>2021-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/some-late-thoughts</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/some-late-thoughts/">&lt;p&gt;So soon tired!—how very lively was I,&lt;br /&gt;

My solitude has been kindly lent to me by my father, because of whom our family had been quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might, from the context, be detected that I am not satisfied for being quarantined and being stuck at home; whereas it is apparent fact that, if you happen to possess the correct information about me, staying at home all day long should suffices me very well —it was in sooth a wonderful reconciliation: how I indeed luxuriated myself in Brandes’ multitudinous talks on european literature, in Chateaubriand’s &lt;em&gt;Mémoires d’Outre-Tombe&lt;/em&gt; (shame how I hadn’t the chance to have a tasteful of the steak named after him), and in short yet wholesome history of the States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days after quarantine also had their charms. The very first day after quarantine had opened with a restless picturesque morning of gusty sunshine and oppressively low clouds, hanging in the heaven, as if they were to fall. And soon they did. Summer rains—dancing spirits of the skies—did lightly swiftly fall. Closing my laptop, I realised the &lt;em&gt;à propos&lt;/em&gt; of singing birds has no more than a thing to tell—it was time for me to step out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air is warm as your love’s cheek, golden as canary. &lt;em&gt;Golden?&lt;/em&gt; not the finest word for summer. Leave it be—an odd colour is meant for a special summer. I proceeded to pace, out of my temple, out of the complexes, out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sententious people are fond of telling us that we change entirely every seven years, that in that time every single atomy in our bodies, the carbon or some similar atoms of that sort, finds a substitute. I, nevertheless, am of opinion that we change way sooner and oftener, that rather we are at most weekly in our constitution. I, for one, do. Never have I ever enjoyed going out, pacing steadily amid nature’s humid fog. Or perhaps my atoms were still whilst I was the one who changed?—As, say, a man who ate only plain rice for some two weeks would presumably find a slice of bread breath-takingly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slice of bread? Think of the degradation! The spacious morning of windswept sunshine, with a cozy bite in the keen air—warm—warm and cozy; now but a hasteful bite in the rough cheap bread. Ay, I should work on my rhetoric more indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">It had been with a beating and happy heart (as seen in my former blog https://blog.knowscount.cc/summer-vacation/), that I had passed up the doorsteps (albeit there being none) and entered a lift to my home on a morning in early June; whereafter approaching the door to this hushed familiar temple, wherein I was to take Summer silently and seperated from this wondrous world.

I (and when I say I, I must be understood to be speaking dramatically) only venture to evince pride once per century; and I do reckon our achievements in World Scholars Cup does make me quite proud—of myself, and of course, the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life itself, according to Mr Meredith, ‘is but a little holding, lent / to do a mighty labour.’ Indeed, we, a few little holdings, as Mr Owen would describe it, ‘trudged through sludge’—the sludge of all provided academic information and challenges we met during the tournament, and mightily did labour into the very last round—the round wherein the world shall compete—the Tournament of Champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip itself, to put it in a way that is no exaggeration for me, is perfect. My measure of all academic trips, though, is more about, rather than about the academic part—I never fancied Coeus—the fun. We had pizza parties, and Scholar’s Bowl where we danced and ranted and roared. The fun, however, does not disappear when we had the chance to write, to answer, and to debate; to wit: the competition has powerfully breathed into all the studies the unifying breath of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end my platitude above, I would like to use a sentence of, not from one of those aforementioned giants, mine in the very first round of debate of this tournament—”dream mightily and do bravely” as by doing so you could, like us, win yourself facts far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">It is curious fact that, albeit exciting, we got the chance to enter the Yale round.

And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?  —Matthew 21 – 16, KJV&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must, sadly yet inevitably, admit to Jesus that I have never, nor had the chance to, finish Psalm, and therefore, Psalm 8:2. Whereas must I? No wonder admitting one’s lack of knowledge and being humble is a great virtue, praised by all those virturous and valiant; yet supposing one of the priests and scribes knows, like me, not what Psalm 8:2 was about, should he, whilst all other nodding, with a smile, say &lt;em&gt;‘I have never.’&lt;/em&gt; So began to jig and jingle my wonders as in Bible this morn I read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, from time to time, asked ‘how poeticule talk?’ One like me, however, is at loggerhead with the manifestation of this question—I would evince emotions of the other way around when, albeit more idealistic, ‘Ought poeticule talk?’ For there be no more wearing demand than that of compulsory—better educational—conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grandeurs of our world is quiet, as an exemplar. Never do the honeysuckles and roses grow nattering about their &lt;em&gt;à-propos&lt;/em&gt;; never did an old book that my great grandfather once used as a privy talk about its past until my mother saw me holding it; the pompous Great Wall of China never did flute nothing about the people, whilst building it, who deceased. What, then, would happen if they do talk? There, in their proper context, dear readers, are many a man of charisma and charm: the nightingales would no longer sing to Keats about &lt;em&gt;the weariness, the fever and the fret&lt;/em&gt;, but of found worms—now never would we, by any chance, quote ‘Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!’ but call it a &lt;em&gt;shrieking harbinger&lt;/em&gt; like wise Shakespeare did; irksome would the giggles of morning stars would sound when with awestruck antiphony we stand with the citizens of Verona to gaze, and to witness, the death of two young lovers. How very generous of Artemis for her beings are so silent!—They, at the very least, make no more sound than the tall primeval trees rocking ‘eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘There is a silence where hath been no sound,&lt;br /&gt;
                There is a silence where no sound may be,&lt;br /&gt;
                In the cold grave — under the deep, deep sea,&lt;br /&gt;
Or in wide desert where no life is found,&lt;br /&gt;
Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound;’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe my writers are like the Old Testament’s heroes of faith, of whom the writer of Hebrews says, “that they without us should not be made perfect” (Hebrews 11:40, KJV). Is that what they see in me, and is that why they published? Are they watching me now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;VS Code in the browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it seemed, in every aspect, worth a deploy; so I tried, following the documentatio, on my ubuntu 20 vps. the procedures below are also tested and evidently worked on a CentOS 7 machine. as for other operating systems, please go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://coder.com/docs/code-server/v3.10.2/guide&quot;&gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a front-end developer, I can hardly say I know anything about servers. Therefore I dry-runned the install script lest slight mishaps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and everything seemed, absolutely fine to me, so I ran the install script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other way to do this is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tar xzvf code-server-3.4.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv code-server-3.4.1-linux-x86_64 code-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;run, after one of the two aforementioned methods are done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;entering editing mode by hitting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; key, change the content of the file to below:&lt;/p&gt;
