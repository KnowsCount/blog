fled is that music:—do I wake or sleep?&lt;br /&gt;
—Keats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She shut her eyes upon her bed,&lt;br /&gt;
And beauty glows about;&lt;br /&gt;
The beam of glamour ‘round her head,&lt;br /&gt;
A bard could only doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She lays on bed a nakèd wise:&lt;br /&gt;
And I am standing by;&lt;br /&gt;
—To feel the wishes in her eyes&lt;br /&gt;
The world I would defy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head upon my shoulder seeks&lt;br /&gt;
To think it carefully;&lt;br /&gt;
But lo!—how blushful are her cheeks:&lt;br /&gt;
I lay down carelessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her damask lips grow fairer still&lt;br /&gt;
—Like cherry dews herself;&lt;br /&gt;
The soft white bosom, like a hill,&lt;br /&gt;
Is plump upon this elf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eyes of ink, and hair of silk&lt;br /&gt;
Have found their place on me;&lt;br /&gt;
Complexion hers is white as milk,&lt;br /&gt;
My eyesight leaves not she.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The falls of ink upon her head&lt;br /&gt;
Doth flow like inmost dream:&lt;br /&gt;
—the lock of hair that half abed&lt;br /&gt;
How sleek and smooth doth seem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her eyes emit voracious lust,&lt;br /&gt;
A lust that I obey:&lt;br /&gt;
For with an ardour full robust,&lt;br /&gt;
Beside her I do lay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My arms then ‘round her breasts doth twine&lt;br /&gt;
And mouth agapèd wide;&lt;br /&gt;
My hands then claspèd ‘round the shrine&lt;br /&gt;
Behind her bras unti’d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her legs curl upwards slightly bent,&lt;br /&gt;
And gapeth wide apart;&lt;br /&gt;
She nods her head and gave consent&lt;br /&gt;
For me to make a start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hold her hands and grab her knee,&lt;br /&gt;
As quick as light’ning’s leap;&lt;br /&gt;
But looking up I see not she:&lt;br /&gt;
A shadow nigh me creep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind then mocks my boyishness:&lt;br /&gt;
I was in dreamland deep!&lt;br /&gt;
That little nymph who dwells in me&lt;br /&gt;
Had lullèd me asleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I open my unwilling eyes&lt;br /&gt;
Towards the rising beam:&lt;br /&gt;

Politics, at the root level, is just opinions whereby one endeavours to derive policy from; therefore, just like a living human being cannot ‘have no opinion’, he cannot be ‘whole-heartedly apolitical’. A parallel apparent truth is that all men, however isolated from society, remains a social animal; and again cannot be entirely apolitical. For, however he who dwells in the innermost of the wilderness should shun it, the very act of isolating himself by escaping society and politics is one of the purest and most symbolic political acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas from that which I observe lately many do not believe so. Some fail to remember—often deliberately—this most familiar axiom of human nature, which should have been rooted-deeply already in every one of our souls since Aristotle, at least. A late exemplar can be easily seen should you go to websites of &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org&quot;&gt;React.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt; and so forth—an often criticised banner can be seen: ‘Support Ukraine 🇺🇦, Help Provide Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine. ‘ it says. The criticisers claim that tech should be free from politics, thus such act of trying to help victims of war out is to be condemned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, then, if one must not participate in political activities, how does he achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the sound reasoning of why organisations must not express their political views from criticisers, their answer to this questions is yet simple: be blind. The aforementioned forgetfulness often involves the notion of disregarding reality; that is, to remark nothing upon the inconstant phantasmagorias that should soon pass as a dream before you: work nothing out of it, reflect nothing upon the matter, better see nothing of it, and most importantly keep the, as the old proverb goes, ‘golden silence’. These very sound arguments may be deemed sagacious and learned till we should examine their emptiness—what, for instance, is all this rigmarole about facing the changes of modern world with no reactions but a more pompous way of phrasing conservatism? how, I ask, is all this gibberish about keeping silent better than ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that ‘I am apolitical’, is nothing less political than saying ‘I stand with Ukraine’—for it is indeed opinions and statements which construct politics, and the assertion above is both.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">It is, I am given to understand, no new nor profound knowledge that everything in human world is, to some degree, political.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that is a pronoun referring back to a noun phrase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;which is the relative pronoun used for inanimate antecedents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to put it simply, in ‘a be that which c [verb]’, that refers to ‘a’, whilst ‘which’ refers to ‘that’. for instance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a very small part of acting is that which takes place on stage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is the same as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a very small part of acting is acting which takes place on stage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which equates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a very small part of acting is what takes place on stage (..informal)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the ones who does not like the usage of ‘which’, ‘that which’ can also be ‘that that’: ‘the latent opposition to rearming Germany is as strong as that that has found public expression.’ (from ‘The Careful Writer’ by Per Bernstein, ‘Let it be noted that there are two exceptions to the use of that to introduce a defining clause. One is a situation in which the demonstrative that and the relative that come together, as in this sentence: …[the example from above]… ‘, ‘the second exception is a situation in which the relative follows a preposition: for example, of which, not of that.’)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some definitions that might help&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inanimate&quot;&gt;inanimate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘inanimate’ (or ‘non-animate’, ‘non-personal’): not being, and never having been alive. grammatically, an inanimate noun or pronoun have no referent that includes a human, animal, plant or other entity which is considered alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inanimate-whose&quot;&gt;inanimate whose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a fun thing to mention here is ‘inanimate whose’ (whose inanimate, non-personal whose, and neuter whose): whose indicates that the antecedent has a possessive role in the relative clause (‘the man whose daughter I married’), but it can also refer to things as well as animate objects (‘I found a car whose battery was dead’); the use of the inanimate whose dates from the 15th century, but since the 18th century has drawn criticism from those who consider whose to be the genitive (possessive) only of the relative pronoun who and therefore believe it should be restricted to personal antecedents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the preferred substitute is of which the, which I find clumsy and overly formal (as in ‘that’s the car of which the alarm keeps waking us up at night.’). The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language emphasises it is perfectly grammatical (‘genitives … are completely grammatical and by no means exceptional’, pp. 1049–1050).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;examples&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I could a tale unfold whose lightest word / Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, (Hamlet I.v)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;or&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes / Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows. (Two Gentlemen of Verona, III.ii)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;or&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And they said; Goe to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. (Genesis 11:4, KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;antecedents&quot;&gt;antecedents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘antecedents’: an expression that gives its meaning to a proform (pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adverb, etc.). such as the her in ‘tina did her homework’, as the pronoun ‘her’ refers to and takes meaning from ‘tina’.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">‘that which’</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">😶 Some Late Thoughts</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/some-late-thoughts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="😶 Some Late Thoughts" /><published>2021-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/some-late-thoughts</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/some-late-thoughts/">&lt;p&gt;So soon tired!—how very lively was I,&lt;br /&gt;
