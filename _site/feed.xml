--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, a new invitation-only app &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joinclubhouse.com&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the market and had a huge triumph along with another invitation-only email app &lt;a href=&quot;https://hey.com&quot;&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt;. That makes me wonder: why is invitation-only strategy winning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/dayne-topkin-u5Zt-HoocrM-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;invitation-only&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first triumph of invitation-only strategies that I am aware of is the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmail.com/&quot;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt; (and there is a hardship distinguishing whether that success had anything to do with its initial invite-only policy or other factors XD). You might also recall &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; was born for a finite group of audiences, perhaps for some of the same reasons one might institute an invite-only policy. Some other exemplars that were once invitation-only I know of are &lt;a href=&quot;http://dribbble.com&quot;&gt;Dribbble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, etc. (note: all mentioned above are not invitation-only anymore).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent examples are Clubhouse (by &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/alpha-exploration-co/id1481002987&quot;&gt;Alpha Exploration Co&lt;/a&gt;, initially released in April 2020) and Hey (by &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, initially realeased in June 2020). Both of them achieved a huge success as startups, and I am, in the next few paragraphs, going to provide you with some basic information about these two products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hey&quot;&gt;Hey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/391bpr.png&quot; alt=&quot;hey-poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Email sucked for years. Not anymore — we fixed it. HEY’s fresh approach transforms email into something you want to use, not something you’re forced to deal with. - hey.com homepage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hey.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introductory Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/hey-62dbfc18-c745-4d86-9a5b-a23a1f4d9eb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey is the first thing because it is considered to be more &lt;strong&gt;‘conventional’&lt;/strong&gt;. Why so? Invitation-only used to be a marketing strategy for email companies. For instance, Gmail. Gamil went viral, so viral that some were selling Gmail invites on eBay (same thing with Hey and Clubhouse invites for hundreds of dollars &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1356102192285900801&quot;&gt;(case 1)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272885291624226816?lang=en&quot;&gt;(case 2)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clubhouse&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/ux9Tox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;clubhouse-poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clubhouse is the new hotness right now in the tech. - Product Hunt Daily, 20th May, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joinclubhouse.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Clubhouse that motivated me to write this blog; it is also Clubhouse that motivated me to do the research and thus found Hey… So remember to say thanks to Alpha Exploration, Basecamp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, back to the topic, the really interesting thing about Clubhose is how it uses the invitation-only system to basically build exclusivity, virtually like it’s a &lt;strong&gt;private circle&lt;/strong&gt; wherein you have to know somebody as to join and thereby increased the value of the invitation and, as most of us desire to see that which we’ve been missing out on, makes it more likely for people to fight for the invitation. &lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse took that to the extreme&lt;/strong&gt;: I still haven’t seen my invitation yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why, after all, is this strategy successful, then? What makes it different from all other marketing models?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would conclude that which I said above, invitation-only succeeded for the fact that it conveys a sense, albeit possibly forged, of exclusiveness, and most of us get a hard on for that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there stands one huge strength of invitation-only apps: &lt;strong&gt;it ensures quality&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshsteimle/&quot;&gt;Josh Steimle&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Invite only isn’t a zero-sum game. On our social networking site there is a strong content creation component, not unlike with Medium. And as Medium does we could opt to invite only certain users to have an account and create content on the site, while others would only have access to view content on the site. Or we could allow all users to create accounts and “like”, “favorite”, or “follow” content and content producers, while content creation itself would still be temporarily restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, invitation-only could be a representative of &lt;strong&gt;higher quality&lt;/strong&gt;, as not all people can in this case write on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So… Anyone willing to give me a Clubhouse invitation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">🤔 Tips for Starting Startups</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/starting-startups-what-to-think/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="🤔 Tips for Starting Startups" /><published>2021-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/starting-startups-what-to-think</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/starting-startups-what-to-think/">&lt;!--

--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working a lot on my project ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://fissure1.misasky.com&quot;&gt;Fissure&lt;/a&gt;’ recently and relentlessly whilst playing a quite important role in a startup Mount and Blade modding Studio Chronicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve ergo gained some experiences in working on startup projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly pitching. pitching is one of the most important aspect of your startup. No matter how great your ideas are, your startup is useless if you cannot convey it and you don’t have any capital. If you cannot inspire people, your startup is more than useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;but wait what if I can make a product that doesn’t require much capital?… and teamwork is not needed! I can totally handle backend, frontend, security, marketing, &lt;del&gt;HR (not needed)&lt;/del&gt; by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well.. If you cannot convey your ideas to customers then you’re not going to have any customers, and if you don’t have any customers, then your startup is useless, still. Every single interaction relating to your startup will somehow require you to pitch it. Now that is why it is essential to perfect your pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easier said than done. Here are the seven questions you should answer as clearly as possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Test your idea with &lt;em&gt;Email test&lt;/em&gt;, that is, to send an email to a competent friend and ask him to re-explain to you with his own words, and if they can do that, you’re golden! If you wish to, you can follow the following template:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; To: Competent Friend
 Subject: My Startup
 ---
 my startup is about **xyz** and it solves the problem of *abc* using *ijk*.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is the market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Inverstors look at Return on Invensment so if you don’t have a market, they’ll never invest, so you need a market. Do not make your market target too wide or too low… make it correct. You’re only wasting one another’s time if you are making up numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your progress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Investors want to make sure you are actually doing something… so, what is possible in a given time frame?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your unique insight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Or, in some sense, what is your competitive advantage? How are you different from any other alike-products out there in the market? What makes it likely for your startup to suceed in the market?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your bussiness model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How are you to make money? Are you the ‘grow fast think about money later’ type or are you the ‘making money right now’ type of company? It’s always wise to have a plan of attack when it comes to monetisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s on your team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What are your standards and credentials whose technical? Who’s doing what? Is everyone useful? Are you as lean as possible? These are the questions to ask yourself all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you want?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The answer to this can be money, or simply to tell your mom you’re actually doing something and you’re not wasting her life-savings doing some paltry projects LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these in mind, you’ll be able to do ten-second pitches to a five-minute presentation with demo.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">🌐 Forcing us to Use Chrome?!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/google-forces-to-use-chrome/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="🌐 Forcing us to Use Chrome?!" /><published>2021-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/google-forces-to-use-chrome</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/google-forces-to-use-chrome/">&lt;!--

&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/limiting-private-api-availability-in.html&quot;&gt;Chromium blog post&lt;/a&gt;, it was stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During a recent audit, we discovered that some third-party Chromium based browsers were able to integrate Google features, such as Chrome sync and Click to Call, that are only intended for Google’s use. This meant that a small fraction of users could sign into their Google Account and store their personal Chrome sync data, such as bookmarks, not just with Google Chrome, but also with some third-party Chromium based browsers. We are limiting access to our private Chrome APIs starting on March 15, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/photo-1501250987900-211872d97eaa.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;photo-1501250987900-211872d97eaa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google Chrome teams has also sent an &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/embedder-dev/c/NXm7GIKTNTE/m/Qxcew5lfCAAJ?pli=1&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, announcing their future plans to ban third-party browsers from using account synchronisation, and this irritated Linux distribution developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reported that from 15 March, users of third-party browsers based on Chromium using the configurations of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google_default_client_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google_default_client_secret&lt;/code&gt; will not be able to sign in to their Google Accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Google, they – in recent audits – found some Chromium based browsers using services and APIs designed only for Google Chrome, most importantly, Chrome Sync API. Therefore, Google decided to remove the visiting of these APIs from third parties, claiming the decision is made as to enhance data security of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux distribution developers who have been using those APIs and services for the past decade, on the other hand, evinced their angriness and expressed it to Google by saying they will have to &lt;strong&gt;cease from maintaining Chromium software package&lt;/strong&gt; as it will become pointless. Jochen Eisinger, Chrome’s Director of Engineering, responded that &lt;strong&gt;they will firmly stick to their decision in future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, Slackware Linux and Arch Linux are already considering to &lt;strong&gt;remove Chromium from their repos&lt;/strong&gt;. Take Arch Linux’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2021-January/030263.html&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jochen Eisinger (Director of Engineering, Chrome) has confirmed that the killing of our API keys is a done deal. He also does not seem interested in the slightest bit to explore possible remedies for Chromium packages … I am going to stop maintaining Chromium and be in favor of dropping the package from our repos, though I have a feeling someone will want to adopt it despite the reduction in functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A genteel country maid greedy of flowers wandered amid the alien corns, and pressed the vivid petals whereon diamond-dews rests tenderly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was halfway through springtime, mid-time of auspiciousness. The pines tall and erect are dotted with countless tiny sparks of greenish-brown, which will in short blaze up the wild hedgerow; yet this untimely eyeless man has placed himself in yon beauteous elms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eyeless! I know whereof I speak, ‘tis precisely this eyelessly blind man, whom lies and dreams with the light-winged Dryad of the trees. He, weariness-wrecked, was in a dream – a wintry dream golden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night the blind man dreamt that he was blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interlocking muscles on his face, drunk with fatigue, are trembling and shivering, under sharp and everlasting pain. Then, awakened by powder shells dropping gently before him, he quickly stood up and ran off deep into the woods, far away from the once melodious birds on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of us die.&lt;/em&gt; he thought, &lt;em&gt;the Krauts and us British lads. And even the birds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/photo-1494972688394-4cc796f9e4c5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;photo-1494972688394-4cc796f9e4c5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His case is simple and standard. His company rumoured about all the lads going blind, thus he began to wonder, to imagine, what it would be like if he, likewise, goes blind; he then closed his eyes to try it and when he was finally able to reopen it, he was already blind. This is why he has no name – blind man doesn’t need a name, he is his voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Therefore it doesn’t matter now.&lt;/em&gt; He said to himself, &lt;em&gt;All of us goes blind after we die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas now he cowered, for he heard some men, perched upon their blade, along with the loud drones of machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, to everything its proper season, just because you rise early does not mean that you will die sooner. Therefore I shall keep myself alive.&lt;/em&gt; He nodded as he pondered. He, thus, started going backward into the woods wherein the fresh shells lie. The guards, however, saw him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guards ranted, roared and chased. They were Englishmen. I can assure you, the blindest of them all is not the eyeless blind man, he is but the firing guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ‘twas all but a dream before his death. Out of the five battalions that fought on the fields, there wasn’t anyone who truely witnessed the hideous state of the dead man’s body, the face and skull blown to smithereens by the gunshots, three holes where bullets had penetrated the neck and the region of the breastbone; nor was there anyone who saw the last smile: &lt;em&gt;I don’t think we did go blind, I think we are blind, Blind but seeing, Blind people who can see, but do not see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dew evaporated, the petals dried, the country-maid plucked the flower, touching the moistureless petals with her fingers – a vivid life can become such a weakling after being abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">The breeze, albeit mild, has long dandled daffodils; the sun, albeit glaring, has long flickered aground.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">🖲 逃离信息茧房 - CyberV</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/info-cocoons/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="🖲 逃离信息茧房 - CyberV" /><published>2021-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/info-cocoons</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/info-cocoons/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;当今我们活在一个算法统治的互联网里&quot;&gt;当今，我们活在一个算法统治的互联网里。&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI 灭绝人类，还太遥远；AI 主宰人类，业已开始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;标题说，逃离信息茧房，可信息茧房是什么？我将怎么带你们逃离信息茧房？CyberV 又是什么？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;信息消费个人化&quot;&gt;信息消费个人化&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;现在各大内容平台背后都有强大的算法支撑，以带给在座诸位他们想要看到的内容。听起来很好，不是么？——但是，在这同时，他们的第一目的其实是让使用者尽可能地消费更多东西：内容、商品、时间，因而提高其流量收益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在我们某宝时，首页基本是前一次搜索物品的同款；在我们某乎时，搜索或者点赞、评论、收藏了某内容，接下来会越来越多推荐相似的内容；在我们抖 y 时，看到的新内容本质都是相似的；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/facebook.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;facebook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所以，你可以为自己打造一份「个人日报」。暂且不恐怖吧？是的，还不恐怖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;消费内容重复化&quot;&gt;消费内容重复化&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不过，这在满足你的大脑反馈机制的同时，这种以用户画像实现的个性化也会编织一个「信息茧房」——内容的同质化。更详细一些：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;信息茧房是指人们关注的信息领域会习惯性地被自己的兴趣所引导，从而将自己的生活桎梏于像蚕茧一般的“茧房”中的现象。 由于信息技术提供了更自我的思想空间和任何领域的巨量知识，一些人还可能进一步逃避社会中的种种矛盾，成为与世隔绝的孤立者。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;人们更愿意接触自己感兴趣的内容，这受人的天性或者说思想惰性的制约，而技术公司就是利用了这样的弱点，于无形之中诱导你进入信息密闭的空间，把你困在一样的声音里，与真正的社会脱钩。怎么样，恐怖了么？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;消费群体割裂化&quot;&gt;消费群体割裂化&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这会造成什么？——网络空间巴尔干化，把所有人分裂成有着不同利益目标、价值信仰、兴趣取向的繁多群类，并将所有人困在自己的茧房里。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;标题又说，「逃离」信息茧房，我们为什么要逃离？要怎么逃？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;为什么&quot;&gt;为什么？&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;信息茧房能给世界带来无尽的伤害，随便举几个例子：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在推荐算法中，第一个 E 代表 Explore，也就是探索用户新兴趣，扩展用户认知；第二个 E 代表 Exploit，也就是通过已有的用户画像利用、开发用户的时间、金钱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一个 E 越大，则短期收益越低，长期体验更好；第二个 E 越大，则短期收益越高，茧房效应越强。猜猜资本选择了哪个？——在垄断、竞争的压力、行业巨头的规则下，只能竭尽全力地提高第二个 E，第一个 E 沦为了做给市场、投资方看的道具。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所以，平台并不想摒弃信息茧房。很多平台在不论政府还是投资方的压迫下，尝试扭转这一局面，但用户数量众多且调整难度大，打破信息茧房的尝试就集中在信息供给方——媒体与平台，尤其集中于平台算法机制方面，平台算法的优化，只是减轻信息茧房，平衡信息茧房的因与果，无法消灭信息茧房。&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage&quot;&gt;NKCS Storage Management System&lt;/a&gt; had some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/commit/main&quot;&gt;major updates&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;versioning&lt;/a&gt; and security vulnerabilities &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/pull/10&quot;&gt;(such as bumping ini from 1.3.5 to 1.3.8)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huzzah. I still has not finished &lt;em&gt;The Gay Genius&lt;/em&gt;. It is a bit too boring for me. And as for the English book, I am currently on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7321&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nibelungenlied&lt;/em&gt; by G. H. Needler&lt;/a&gt;. Yes. &lt;em&gt;The Prisoner of Zenda&lt;/em&gt; was not the best choice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;homework&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still a Chinese poster/timeline tbd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;video-games&quot;&gt;Video Games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t talk this into me. Didn’t play ‘em for ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;telly-shows&quot;&gt;Telly Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still watching &lt;em&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">I’ve done quite a few things this week and shall hereby record them.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;要怎么实现允许用户提交内容至不同故事线？&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我们准备沿用 &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; 的思想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/tXVfBV{/suffix}&quot; alt=&quot;suffix}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;每一个不同的故事线都是一个 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;branch&lt;/code&gt;，但是为了预防引发选择困难症，我们会把最先达到六个新提交的 branch 设为默认，类似区块链中的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jianshu.com/p/267f0572e241&quot;&gt;最长链原则&lt;/a&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;为啥不是 CVS、SVN 这些集中式的版本控制系统？&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;因为 Linus 不喜欢它们。&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;引用廖雪峰老师的话：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;版本库是集中存放在中央服务器的，而干活的时候，用的都是自己的电脑，所以要先从中央服务器取得最新的版本，然后开始干活，干完活了，再把自己的活推送给中央服务器。中央服务器就好比是一个图书馆，你要改一本书，必须先从图书馆借出来，然后回到家自己改，改完了，再放回图书馆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这意味着甚么？——&lt;strong&gt;你必须要联网，才能工作。&lt;/strong&gt;你提交代码时的爽与不爽，还得看网速的脸色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/xotvXZ{/suffix}&quot; alt=&quot;suffix}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;当然，有些地方 git 也不完全适合我们的平台，所以我们准备&lt;strong&gt;把 git 融入区块链&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;把 git 融入区块链？会有哪些难点？&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主要的难点在于 git 版本控制的分布式与区块链的分布式还是有比较大的区别的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Git:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;相当于其分布式的核心是除了中心服务器，自己的电脑本身也保存了仓库的整个拷贝，即使在不联网的情况下也可以完成版本的工作和更新。&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所以，git 的分布式是‘&lt;strong&gt;中心化下的分布式&lt;/strong&gt;’。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;区块链：&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;区块链的分布式就要严格的多，以比特币为例，所有的区块节点都保存了整个链上的区块信息（忽略优化省略的部分）这意味着你不仅保存了你的相关交易的区块信息，而也保存了其他人的交易信息。你保存的信息将作为一个 prover 参与到比特币的信任机制之中。&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所以，区块链的分布式是‘&lt;strong&gt;去中心化的分布式&lt;/strong&gt;’。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;来，上图：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/5IQAYr{/suffix}&quot; alt=&quot;suffix}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;等等，我会和在区块链中一样要保存所有交易记录吗？&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不会。这就是 git 的部分了。你只用保存你所贡献的记录，当然把它删掉也没得问题，但这就要求你们信赖我们能够好好保管你珍贵的文章片段了。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">版本控制</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">🎄 2020 Christmas Journal 1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020-christmas-journal-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="🎄 2020 Christmas Journal 1" /><published>2020-12-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020-christmas-journal-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020-christmas-journal-1/">&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a few things this week and shall hereby record them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have, firstly, started this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coding&quot;&gt;Coding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also kept making contributions to GitHub over the past … well, more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://knowscount-1304485449.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/contributions.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have created, and contributed to a few repositories, too. I, for instance, contributed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hack-chat/hackchat-client&quot;&gt;new client&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hack.chat&quot;&gt;hack chat&lt;/a&gt; (it looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.hack.chat&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;), a minimal, distraction-free chat app (though it somewhat caused more &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hack-chat/hackchat-client/issues/30&quot;&gt;internationalisation issues&lt;/a&gt;); started a ReactJS tutorial page; fixed a fatal &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/issues/1&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; on the beta-version project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage&quot;&gt;NKCS Storage System&lt;/a&gt; (the current fatal issues are the potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies); sketched the basic &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/WeeBlog&quot;&gt;framework (outline)&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeblog.knowscount.vercel.app/&quot;&gt;WeeBlog&lt;/a&gt; project, ‘a beauteous content sharing platform solution orchestrated to be sexy and concise’; made a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/yuanyuan&quot;&gt;photo-wall&lt;/a&gt; for one of my cyber-security friend under his request as his birthday is approaching; forked and changed some bit of the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KnowsCount/logoly&quot;&gt;logoly&lt;/a&gt; which is not appropriate for one to describe here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also shifting from using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; as my node package manager (even though npm stands for node package manager) to Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I don’t like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Mark-Zuckerberg-so-hated&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-not-like-to-use-Facebook&quot;&gt;don’t like Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. But what can I do?– My favourite &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org&quot;&gt;ReactJS&lt;/a&gt; is developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/react&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; is just great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, under the demand of my Chinese teacher, finished a part of &lt;em&gt;The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su DongPo&lt;/em&gt; wherein the word Gay is used the old-fashioned way. Fun fact: this book is a masterpiece writ by a Chinese writer named Lin Yutang, yet it was an English book – the version I am reading is translated into Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my English homework, I have been reading &lt;em&gt;The prisoner of Zenda&lt;/em&gt;. I planned to read Edgar Allan Poe’s at first, but has given up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;homework&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done my Chinese homework but the reading part; a part of Maths homework. I plan to finish the poster and therefore Science homework today (on 23 Dec).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;video-games&quot;&gt;Video Games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days ago I played video games the whole morning, and nothing remarkable happened. It was that evening when I. intentionally, deleted a Europa Universalis &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;savegame&lt;/code&gt; which I spent tens of hours on… I was Great Britain in the savegame, and was therefore too strong, and the game thereby became boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;telly-shows&quot;&gt;Telly Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started watching &lt;em&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt; again – the third time, also the funeral episode of &lt;em&gt;The IT crowd&lt;/em&gt; which I watched over and over for a few million times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">I’ve done a few things this week and shall hereby record them.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">✏️ 冬——随笔</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/winter-memo/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="✏️ 冬——随笔" /><published>2020-12-21T15:00:05+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-21T15:00:05+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/winter-memo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/winter-memo/">&lt;p&gt;人类初创的年岁，没有凛冬，只有春夏与秋，却也是呼腾呼腾地闹着，就如当初伊的膀子呼呼地抡着，万物不乏活力；然天帝似乎不大乐意如此的局面，觉得实在缺少了甚么，就恶趣地给天地加入了一个新的时令，名之曰「冬」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;人类热心家的猛士们便奋勇地站出了，严辞地反抗肃杀的冷冬。这样的局面娱乐了天帝，觉得似乎一切又都平衡了，于是昏昏然眯了过去。人类的其他热心家看他们的猛士们似乎抗议未果，就也奋勇地站出，谴责这些颓废货色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;人们过了几个肃杀的凛冬；北国飘了几年的鹅毛，南国下了几年的白霜。——说到这雪呵，天帝确乎是只给北国降了大雪，不知是疏忽还是善意，没有给南国留甚么极多的雪。南国的人民便愈发高傲，有了些天选之子的论调；北国的人民愈发恼怒，总觉得也要说些甚么，但总话未出口便被自己堵住。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这么僵着，又是几年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;北国的学者从原先精神抖擞，到了倚靠拐杖，终于作出了一章《雪国凤年论》，谐音了丰年，很是得意。而从此北国的学者逢人就讲塞恩斯，瑞雪兆丰年。北国的人于是有了比南国人民更高一些的作威作福资本，使南国人很是不快。南国人便派出学者，先私下去北国考察，又闭门苦读十五年，才作另一文章——大致引了北国人著名的话：「雪是雨水的精魂」，给其予「精魂是证明雪是煞死了的」的反驳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这时天帝终于醒来，看到这样的局面，更觉娱乐，便哈哈大笑起来。神清气爽着，他想起奖励下人类，于是要收回冬季。多年不见的人类热心家的猛士们便再次奋勇地站出了，誓死捍卫冬天的存在，这次倒要更猛烈尖锐些，甚者居然说出了「神心不古，天将不天」的造反话。天帝于是震怒，委地球而去。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>KnowsCount</name><email>knowscount@gmail.com</email></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">人类初创的年岁，没有凛冬，只有春夏与秋，却也是呼腾呼腾地闹着，就如当初伊的膀子呼呼地抡着，万物不乏活力；然天帝似乎不大乐意如此的局面，觉得实在缺少了甚么，就恶趣地给天地加入了一个新的时令，名之曰「冬」。</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">✒️ The Upstart Crows</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/shakespeare-community/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="✒️ The Upstart Crows" /><published>2020-12-20T03:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-20T03:57:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/shakespeare-community</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/shakespeare-community/">&lt;p&gt;To be finished.&lt;/p&gt;
