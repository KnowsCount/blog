title: "\U0001F52E 2021 Christmas Journal 2"

Iâ€™ve done quite a few things this week and shall hereby record them. I changed the title date but think it's kinda inadequete to continue using '2', but this does not matter.

### Coding

Still, I kept making contributions on GitHub.

I have started a new project, [fissure](https://github.com/fissureNet), 'a beauteous story collaboration platform orchestrated to be sexy and novel', wherein I suggested a novel [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) ([CCS](https://github.com/fissureNet/CCS-paper), Collaborative Concurrent System) that in a sense combines [git](http://git-scm.com) and [Blockchain](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) together with [a few others](https://github.com/orgs/fissureNet/people). You can take a glance [here](https://github.com/fissureNet/fissure.vue); sadly however, it is not yet open-sourced. Meanwhile, my [NKCS Storage Management System](https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage) had some [major updates](https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/commit/main) on [versioning](https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and security vulnerabilities [(such as bumping ini from 1.3.5 to 1.3.8)](https://github.com/KnowsCount/nkcsStorage/pull/10).


### Books

Huzzah. I still has not finished *The Gay Genius*. It is a bit too boring for me. And as for the English book, I am currently on [*The Nibelungenlied* by G. H. Needler](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7321). Yes. *The Prisoner of Zenda* was not the best choice

### Homework

There is still a Chinese poster/timeline tbd.

### Video Games

Don't talk this into me. Didn't play 'em for ages.

### Telly Shows

Still watching *Silicon Valley*.
